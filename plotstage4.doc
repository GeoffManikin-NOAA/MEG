Plotting Stage IV Data

1)  Make an /stmpp1/Geoffrey.Manikin/precip  directory
2)  Into that directory, copy /com2/pcpanl/prod/pcpanl.YYYYMMDD/ST4*gz  for all dates needed.
    Note that there are 1h, 6h, and 24h totals.   Any of these can be used, depending on need.
3)  gunzip *  in that directory
4)  type the following:
    export NCARG_ROOT=/meso/save/Corey.Guastini/ncl
    export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/bin:/nwprod/util/exec:
    export PATH=${PATH}:/nwprod/util/ush:${NCARG_ROOT}/bin
5)  A sample script is  plot6h_stageiv.ncl  to plot the 6-hour totals

  The following variables can be adjusted to the needs of the case

  a = addfile("/stmpp1/Geoffrey.Manikin/precip/ST4."+modelstrings+".06h","r")

  ;start of period you want
  scriptyyyymmddhh="2017082800"

  ;how long you want accumulation window to be in hours
  acch=12

  ;bounds for plot
  minlat=24.0
  maxlat=34.0
  minlon=-102.0
  maxlon=-88.0

6) ncl plot6h_stageiv.ncl   to run the program
